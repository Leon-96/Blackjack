Blackjack

This is a simple blackjack game which can be played on a linux terminal. 
Python needs to be installed on your machine before playing the game.
Start the game by writing 'python3 blackjack.py' without the quotes on your terminal.
The rules of the game are mentioned when you start the game.
At the end of every game ascii art shows up which tells you your fate.

I will be adding more features such as card ascii arts.
I will also make a version of the game compitable with windows as well.
